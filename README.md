# OMG_Cable_Journey_Documentation
This is the documentation of my OMG Cable research journey for University of Bedfordshire School of Computer Science Cybersecurity Department.
## OMG Cable Introduction
O.MG in as much as it is the name given to this Cable, is also an acronmy for the phrase 'OH My God' that is used when things go wrong. What a coincidence right?
O.MG cable which is like any and every other type of our charging cable cannot be physically differnetiated not even by a Tech professional. Not even when used until harm is caused with it before anyone can identify that something has gone wrong.
### Types of O.MG Cable Active End Port
- USB A
- USB C
- Directional C To C

## What Next
Create Payload script to start launching attacks on the device.

Warring!!!
Make sure there are no sencetive information on the device the OMG Cable is plugged into. 

## Lessons Learnt
1. THE DEVICE THE CABLE IS PLUGGED ON, THE SCRIPT CAN BE EXECUTED ON
2. ATTACK CAN COME FROM DIFFERENT DEVICES AS LONG AS IT IS CONNECTED TO THE OMG WIFI AND THE OMG CABLE ACTIVE END IS PLUGGED IN A DEVICE.
